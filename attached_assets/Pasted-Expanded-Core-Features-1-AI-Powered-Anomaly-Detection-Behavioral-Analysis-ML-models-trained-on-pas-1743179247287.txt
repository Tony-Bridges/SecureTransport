Expanded Core Features
1. AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Behavioral Analysis: ML models trained on past CIT attacks to recognize:

Unusual vehicle movements (sudden stops, U-turns, convoy formation)

Suspicious pedestrian loitering near CIT stops

Predictive Risk Scoring: Assigns threat levels based on location, time, and historical crime data.

2. Facial & Object Recognition for Threat Identification
Facial Recognition:

Scans faces near CIT vehicles in real time

Cross-references with criminal databases

Flags known suspects or persons of interest

Weapon Detection (AI Object Scanning):

Inside Vehicles: Uses millimeter-wave scanning or RF sensors to detect hidden firearms.

Outside Vehicles: Computer vision analyzes CCTV, dashcams, and drones to identify:

Visible firearms (rifles, handguns)

Suspicious objects (crowbars, masks, duffel bags)

Thermal Imaging: Detects hidden weapons under clothing.

3. Dynamic Geo-Tagging & Vehicle Tracking
Automated Suspicious Vehicle Tagging:

When CIT vehicle stops, AI tags all nearby vehicles within 500m.

If CIT moves within 5 minutes, tags are discarded (false alarm prevention).

If CIT remains stationary, tracking continues and threat assessment escalates.

Route Reconstruction:

Uses satellite imagery & traffic cams to map suspect vehicle paths.

Predicts possible escape routes for law enforcement.

4. Satellite & Drone Surveillance Integration
Live Satellite Tracking:

Monitors CIT vehicle movement in high-risk zones.

Provides real-time overhead view during incidents.

Drone Support:

Deploys UAVs for aerial surveillance if an attack is detected.

Tracks fleeing suspects beyond line-of-sight.

5. Real-Time Threat Response System
Automated Alerts:

Notifies armed response teams, police, and central command.

Shares suspect descriptions, vehicle details, and live location.

Vehicle Lockdown & Countermeasures:

Remote engine kill switch if hijacking is imminent.

Smoke screens, GPS jamming, or tire spikes (if legally compliant).
